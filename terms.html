        <h1>Terms and Conditions of Use</h1>
        <p>Last Updated: January 20, 2026</p>
        
        <h2>1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</h2>
        <p>By downloading, accessing, or using the "Lynxi" mobile application ("App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the App.</p>
        <p><strong>Age Restriction:</strong> You must be at least 18 years old to use this App. If you are under 18, you may only use the App with the consent and supervision of a parent or legal guardian.</p>

        <h2>2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE</h2>
        <p>Lynxi is an AI-powered shopping assistant that helps users identify products via image recognition or text search and compares prices across various online retailers.</p>
        <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Lynxi is an information aggregator. We do not sell products directly, nor do we guarantee the availability, authenticity, or price accuracy of the products listed by third-party retailers.</p>

        <h2>3. AI AND ACCURACY DISCLAIMER</h2>
        <p>The App uses Artificial Intelligence (Vertex AI/Gemini) and third-party search engines (Google Search API) to provide results.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Guarantee of Accuracy:</strong> While we strive for precision, AI interpretations can be imperfect (e.g., identifying a similar product instead of the exact model).</li>
            <li><strong>Price Fluctuations:</strong> Prices shown in the App are snapshots found at the time of the search. Real-time prices on the retailer's site may vary.</li>
            <li><strong>User Responsibility:</strong> You acknowledge that Lynxi is a tool for reference. You should always verify the product details and price on the retailer's website before purchasing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. SUBSCRIPTIONS AND USAGE LIMITS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Free Tier:</strong> Users are granted a limited number of free searches per month. Unused credits do not roll over to the next month.</li>
            <li><strong>Premium Subscription:</strong> To access unlimited searches and advanced features, you must purchase a monthly or annual subscription via your Apple ID settings.</li>
            <li><strong>Payment:</strong> Payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.</li>
            <li><strong>Auto-Renewal:</strong> Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. You can manage subscriptions in your Account Settings after purchase.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h2>
        <p>All content within the App, including the "Lynxi" name, logo, design, and code, is the property of <strong>Alejandro Bautista Palacios</strong> and is protected by copyright laws. You may not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the App.</p>

        <h2>6. THIRD-PARTY LINKS AND AFFILIATES</h2>
        <p>The App contains links to third-party websites (e.g., Amazon, Mercado Libre). We are not responsible for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites. Any transaction you make is strictly between you and the retailer.</p>
        <p><strong>Affiliate Disclosure:</strong> Lynxi may participate in affiliate marketing programs. This means we may earn a commission on purchases made through links in our App at no extra cost to you.</p>

        <h2>7. PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
        <p>Your use of the App is also governed by our Privacy Policy, which explains how we collect, use, and share your personal information. By using the App, you consent to the practices described in the Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2>8. TERMINATION</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the App at our sole discretion, without notice, for conduct that we believe violates these Terms or is harmful to other users of the App, us, or third parties, or for any other reason.</p>

        <h2>9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Lynxi shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the App, including but not limited to damages for loss of profits, data, or purchases made based on inaccurate information. The App is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis.</p>

        <h2>10. GOVERNING LAW</h2>
        <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Mexico (specifically the State of Guanajuato), without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>

        <h2>11. CHANGES TO TERMS</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms on this page or within the App. Your continued use of the App constitutes acceptance of those changes.</p>

        <h2>12. CONTACT US</h2>
